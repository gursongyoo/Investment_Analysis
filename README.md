# Investment_Analysis
This is an R code for analyzing Korean government R&D expenditure and outputs.
It imports excel files of past Korean R&D projects and their outputs (research papaer, patent, commercialization, and licensing). These data are not disclosed to public.
It generates interactive Plotly plots that show correlations between R&D investment and outputs in diverse technology areas.
To generate the plots, the code cleans and consolidates yearly datasets containing 50+k projects.
